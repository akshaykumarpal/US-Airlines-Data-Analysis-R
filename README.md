# US Airlines Dataset Analysis using R

Environment: R (3.3.1) and R Studio (1.0.136)

Our main objective was to analyze the US Airlines data-set is to study the trend of airlines cost of different firms along with the distinct predictors like Revenue Output, Load Capacity, Fuel Price etc. over several years. We had build different Linear Models, analyzed each of them side by side to understand the regression and their patterns using several different ways like Histogram, Kernel-Density Plot, Normal QQ-Plot, Overlay Plot, Scatter Plot Matrix, Dot Plot, Box-Plot, Influential Plot, ACF Plot, Correlation Matrix, StripCharts, Joint Confidence, Stepwise Regression, Cross-Validation. 

We came to conclusion that the cost of the US Airlines of each firm depends mostly on the Revenue output and Load capacity rather than Fuel Price.
